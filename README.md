# Understanding Variables and Basic Math in C++

**Make sure to not skip the theory before doing practise.**

In this lesson, we’ll do **variables** in C++ and some **basic math operations**.

## Variables in C++

Think Variables as placeholders for data in your program. In C++, you must declare a variable with a specific type before using it. Here are the variable types:

| Type         | Description                        | Example                       |
|--------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `int`        | Whole numbers (no decimals)        | `int age = 25;`               |
| `double`     | Decimal numbers                    | `double price = 19.99;`       |
| `char`       | Single characters                  | `char grade = 'A';`           |
| `bool`       | Boolean values (`true`/`false`)    | `bool gameOver = false;`      |
| `std::string`| Sequences of characters (text)     | `std::string name = "Alice";` |

### Declaring Variables

You can declare variables in one line:

```cpp
int age = 25;
double price = 19.99;
```

You can also declare multiple variables in one line:
```cpp
int day = 20, month = 12, year = 2024;
```

However, it’s often better to read to declare variables individually.

### Basic Math Operations & When to Use C++  

C++ supports all standard mathematical operations and offers very good performance, making it an ideal choice for tasks that require speed and efficiency. However, while C++ is powerful, it's not always the best tool for every situation.  

For simpler tasks or when rapid development is more important than raw performance, you might find yourself turning to higher-level languages like Python, JavaScript, some cases even Lua. These languages often offer simpler syntax and faster prototype capabilities.  

Remember:  
- **Use C++ when performance matters**, such as in game development, system programming or resource-intensive applications.  
- **Use high-level languages for less demanding tasks** or when you need to prioritize simplicity and development speed.  

C++ is a great tool in your toolbox, but knowing when to use it, is just as important as mastering the language itself.

### Note on Integer Division

When dividing two integers in C++, the result is also an integer. For example:

```cpp
int a = 10, b = 4;
std::cout << a / b; // Output: 2 (not 2.5)
```

If you need the decimal result, use the `double` type:

```cpp
double c = 10.0, d = 4.0;
std::cout << c / d; // Output: 2.5
```

## Wrapping Up

By the end of this lesson, you’ll have learned:
- How to declare and initialize variables in C++
- The variable types and their uses
- Performing simple math operations
- How integer and decimal division differ in C++
- A better project structure (if you noticed how it's organised)

### Practice Exercise

Create a program that:
1. Declares variables for your name, age, and favorite number.
2. Prints them using `std::cout`.
3. Adds two numbers and displays the result.

Good luck, and good coding. Also, the day I'm doing this is almost christmas, so, happy christmas!!!!
